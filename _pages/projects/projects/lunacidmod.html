    No game is perfect, not even <strong>Lunacid</strong>. It's an amazing first-person dungeon crawler that greatly recaptured the experience of the <strong>King's Field</strong> series. 
	I had a blast playing through the early access, but I also had few gripes with it.
	Mainly how it handled death in a very classic way: Reverting your progress to your last save.

    Using ILSpy and my knowledge of the <strong>Unity engine</strong>, I modded in a way more lenient death mechanic that doesn't force the player to repeat previously made actions and steps.
    Starting from there, I added more and more features to accomodate my own and other's needs.

    It's also the first I got paid to add a feature to a mod. 
	I never expected that to happen since I'm making these mods mostly to learn about game development through other people's work.
	And also for fun, of course. ðŸ˜…
