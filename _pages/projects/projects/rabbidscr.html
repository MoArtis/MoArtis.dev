    <strong>Rabbids Crazy Rush</strong> is your typical mobile 3d runner game from the 2010s but benefits from the unique <strong>Rabbids universe</strong>.

    This project was my first opportunity to be in charge of the <strong>game direction</strong> on a project. I had the responsibility to <strong>set the project objectives in term of the player experience.</strong> This goes with writing the design documentation and make sure they are properly communicated to the team. I was eventually joined by a junior Game designer that I mentored through the entire development process.

    Rabbids Crazy Rush started as an opportunity to piggyback on a previous runner game made by Ubisoft Chengdu. What was supposed to be a short reskin turned out to be a long and difficult endeavor. Despite the many challenges and hardship, it was an <strong>insightful experience.</strong> The fact the game has been shipped is still <strong>an achievement that the team can be proud of.</strong>
