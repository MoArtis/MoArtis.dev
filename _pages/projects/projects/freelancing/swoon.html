    <strong>Swoon! Earth Escape</strong> is a classic 2D platformer with a 3D presentation where you play as Swoon, an alien who land crashed on a post-apocalyptic Earth.
	In order to escape you have to collect all the mechanical parts of your spaceship placed in each levels.

	I assisted the solo developer of <strong>Swoon!</strong> throughout the end of its development.
    I rewrote the <strong>Character controller</strong>, helped with <strong>translation system</strong> and assisted the <strong>porting process</strong>.

    I'm glad to have been able to help a fellow indie developer. 
	Hopefully this humble first game might be his first step toward building a successful game studio.
