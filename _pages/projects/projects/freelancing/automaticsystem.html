    I was hired on the project as a subcontractor by the app developer, Oniki agency. They had trouble
    with Unity's latest UI system called <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html">UI Toolkit</a>.

    Helping a team in difficulty is always the most enjoyable contracts as the stakes are much higher, and the impact of my
    contributions is immediate.
