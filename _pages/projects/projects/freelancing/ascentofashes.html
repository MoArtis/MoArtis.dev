    <strong>Ascent of Ashes</strong> is a post-apo colony sim that takes inspiration from Rimworld.

    I worked for 6 weeks as a programmer on some key features like the survivor Needs, the storage system, and UI
    controls.
    It was my first professional experience with <strong>Godot</strong> (as the game has been recently ported from
    Unity),
    and this project allowed me to see how an ambitious game can set up with this engine.

    While I'm proud of the work I did on the project, in a genre that I enjoy, the publisher was unable to continue
    financing the project.
    Hopefully, a new publisher will pick the project up. If so, I will accept any contract coming from that passionate
    team.
