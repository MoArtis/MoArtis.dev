    <strong>Ascent of Ashes</strong> is a post-apocalyptic colony sim inspired from Rimworld.

    I worked for <strong>five months</strong> as a programmer on key features such as crafting, expeditions, survivor needs, storage, a parcel editor for map generation, and various UI controls.

    It was my first professional experience with <strong>Godot</strong>, as the game had recently been ported from Unity. This project gave me some insights into how an ambitious game can be set up using this engine.

    I'm proud of the work I did on the project, in a genre that I enjoy, and I hope to work with the team again after the early access phase, once more funding has been secured. 
    In any case, it was a pleasure to help a passionate team bring their vision to life.
