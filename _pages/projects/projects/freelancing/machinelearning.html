    Thanks to our texture upscaling mod for the classic Resident Evil games, the <strong>RESHDP team</strong> was contracted by
    an editorial director at <strong>one of the largest gaming corporations</strong> which cannot be named due to an
    NDA.
</p>

<p>
    Our 3-person team from three different continents, spent 10 weeks producing documents, prototypes,
    tests and tools related to <strong>machine learning upscaling techniques for remaster projects</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    I took care of the team organization, the client communication, and the development of a tool
    to <strong>procedurally interpolate and compare upscaling models</strong>.
    While I'm proud of this tool made with Python and WPF/C#, 
    the contract made it impossible for me to showcase it to the upscaling community.
</p>

<p>
    With that in mind, I'm very grateful this company entrusted a group of modders like us.
