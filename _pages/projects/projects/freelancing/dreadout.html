    <strong>DreadOut Remastered Collection</strong> is putting the two PC-only original games, <strong>DreadOut
    (2014)</strong> and <strong>Keepers of the dark (2016)</strong> in one improved package for consoles.

    I took part in the herculean effort to port the <strong>Unity 4</strong> codebase to <strong>Unity 2022</strong>.
    As it was expected, a lot of core systems had to be redone due to compatibility issues between these two versions
    and on the necessities of a console port.

    That being said, it was a great experience and my second successful console port effort (after Swoon).
