    <strong>Super Cricket Fighter Turbo</strong> is a crazy mix of Pong and Lethal League for 2 players.

    I collaborated with two friends to release this fun ad-free little toy in our spare time.
    While it was a really fun project, it's also my last mobile game.
    This game and all the previous mobile I worked on are now unavailable due to frequent changes in the store policies.

    I recently decided to port this game to PC and release it on Steam as a Free game.
    It's not an amazing game by any metric, but I think I should do more to preserve these little milestones in my game
    development career.
