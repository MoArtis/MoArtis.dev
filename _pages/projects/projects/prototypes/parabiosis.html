	<strong>Parabiosis</strong> was a retro-styled survival-horror project inspired from the classics of the genre such as <strong>Resident Evil</strong> or <strong>Silent Hill</strong>.
    The player character had to invade other characters inner worlds to help them or harm them in order to survive in a mycelium infested island.

    I spent <strong>16 months</strong> designing and developing all the needed game mechanics and editor tools. 
	From the combat systems to the puzzle mechanics through our innovating rendering technique that allowed to <strong>fake pre-rendered backgrounds</strong>.

    It was a ton of works and I'm still heartbroken that I had to abandon the project due to team frictions. 
	That being said, much of the features can be salvaged and I'm planning to do just that in the near future.
