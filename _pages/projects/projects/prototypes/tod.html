    A 3d <strong>Rogue-lite typing game.</strong> It was an attempt at making Sega's Typing of the Dead more replayable by injecting it with your typical Rogue-lite mechanics like randomized levels, item effects and perma-death.
</p>

    I spent a lot of time <strong>iterating on the core-gameplay</strong> to make sure that it doesn't only challenge the typing speed. Enemies have different stats, attacks but also their own <strong>"typing challenges"</strong> that must be completed to defeat them. Such as answering a question or typing letters in the right order.
    The prototype went as far as including the random level generation, a map system and full mod support.

    I developed a ton of tools (even a <a data-toggle="modal" href="#tod-tool">WPF-based editor</a>) for that project and yet I had to stop working on it as it became clear that it was too challenging for me. I still love the concept so I might scope it down and revisit it in the future.
