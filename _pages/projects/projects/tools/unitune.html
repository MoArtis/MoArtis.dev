    <strong>Unitune</strong> is my second commercial tool for Unity. It's a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file">tracker music player</a> that is fully compatible with WebGL.
    While Unity natively supports the four most common formats on desktop platforms, Unitune brings that number to more than 50.
</p>

<p>
    It also brings granular controls over the music instruments and patterns thanks to its underlying native plugin,
    LibOpenMpt.
    While being a niche tool, anyone considering making a tiny WebGL game should give Unitune a try.

<p>
    The tool was born out of a failed freelancing proposal, making me appreciate my ability to turn a letdown into a new opportunity.
