    I'm working on my third commercial tool for Unity, <strong>ClipSync</strong>. It's a <strong>track-based event
    timeline editor</strong> allowing to synchronize
    timed clips (Animation, audio, etc.) with any sort of game event.
</p>

<p>
    This tool was born out of frustration with how <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationEventsOnImportedClips.html">animation events</a> are currently handled in Unity.
    It replaces the limited, hard-coupled, string-based event triggered at a specific frame with a timeline editor
    allowing events to have a duration and time-based parameters.
</p>

<p>
    The main inspiration for this tool is the fantastic <a href="https://github.com/Meowmaritus/DSAnimStudio">Meowmaritus'
    DSAnimStudio</a>, a TAE file editor used by many FromSoftware games.
    It's my most ambitious tool, and the main challenge lies in keeping the tool flexible and easy to use.
