    My first commercial tool, <strong>FlexMotion</strong> is a code-driven play-on-demand animation system.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of pre-configuring everything in the editor, <strong>FlexMotion</strong> allows you to play any animation when you want and how you need it to be played.
    All of this is done directly in the code which makes it a very efficient tool for prototyping.
    It's also a great fit for a project that implements its character state machine where Mecanim might be redundant.

    There is nothing more validating than receiving positive feedback from your peers about your tools.
    For that, I will always be thankful for the tremendous effort I spent on <strong>FlexMotion</strong>.
